# What I hope to be my personal command line assistant
# A bastardization of ianthehenry/sd

# TODO's
# - For the `script-path` make this actually get a PATH-like path from the
# config and create the logic around all that stuff
# - Add logic for actually accessing/parsing the config file
# - Copier integration for `command-new`, allow different lang templates and
# whatnot
# I'd like to be able to have multiple flags passed to pilot, currently it only
# reads one
# - Have the --new flag take a type of script in order to determine the
# template to use?
